**Softmax Activation Implementation**

The Softmax class provides a robust implementation of the softmax activation function, which converts raw output scores (logits) into probabilities that sum up to 1. It is primarily used for multi-class classification problems, enabling the neural network to make decisions by selecting the class with the highest probability. The implementation ensures numerical stability by subtracting the maximum logit value during computation.
